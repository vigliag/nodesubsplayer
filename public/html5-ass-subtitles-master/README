This pack of javascripts require a HTML5 capable browser to work with the <video> tag. 
I have no intention of supporting .SRT as of this point,  as there is a sufficient 
working library for this around. (jquery-srt.js)

Tested browsers:
	* Google Chrome
		* If you use Google Chrome 11 and experience lags and weird subs blinking 
		  around on the screen, please switch to the Beta or Dev channel instead.
		* Google Chrome and Chromium can't streaming OGG-Theora streams. 
		  It'll have to finish loading first before it display the video.
	* Firefox 3
	* Firefox 4		

CSS2 as well as CSS3 don't provide any commands to scale text and letters
	* affected tags: 
		* \fscx
		* \fscy
		
Commands depending on timers or similar constructs ain't implemented yet. 
	* affected tags: 
		* \t
		* \fad
		* \move

Currently these inline ass tags are known to be working: (apply to the whole line)
	* \pos
		* doesn't take \an into account yet!
	* \be
		* doesn't take original style's border or shadow in account!
	* \1c | \c
	* \3c 
		* only hacky-slashy with text-shadow for non-webkit browsers
	* \b0 | \b1
	* \u0 | \u1
	* \s0 | \s1
	* \i0 | \i1

Some code taken from: 
	* http://blog.illyism.com/html5-video-subtitles-experiment/
		- Basically I took some of the base code from there, 
		  for example parts of the timeupdate() function
	* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/646628/javascript-startswith
		- Some helper functions (startsWith)
